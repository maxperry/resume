        <p>I look forward to the opportunity to be involved in the design and development of an innovative product that can have a positive impact on many people and businesses. I'm a well-rounded tech enthusiast with a flexible and reliable knowledge on a range of technologies, as well as a passion for project management. I have good communication skills and enjoy working in a team, moreover I am comfortable in both leadership and player roles. Finally, I'm used to take ownership and responsibility, thus identifying and solving problems as a matter of course, and making decisions.</p>

      <div class="row text">
        <p>I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science from the University Ca' Foscari of Venice, in 2010 and 2013 respectively. When I started University, in 2007, I had no previous education in Computer Science - apart from being a tech-savvy user. Now I have a solid foundation in <b>software engineering</b>, security of computer systems and computer vision, as well as distributed systems, high performance computing, Web mining and databases.</p>
        <p>At the Bachelor I also attended <b>project management</b> as an optional course, which I immediately put into practice with success - both leading a team and working individually in a project.
        Several courses required a project assignment to be done in teams, among which an e-commerce built with Struts and Hibernate, the project planning of the new information system of the Regione Veneto - including the design of a subsystem - (as a simulation for software engineering), a compiler for the TinyJava language specification with assembly x86 code generation, and a backpropagation neural network for image compression.</p>
        <p>Both my theses involved the design and development of a mobile application. The goal of my Bachelor's thesis was to develop an official app of Ca' Foscari for the iPhone, taking inspiration from iStanford. This work allowed me to learn to code in Objective-C and Cocoa, as well as to engineer a <b>native mobile app</b>.
        Similarly the Master's thesis involved the development of an Android app, but with significant focus on <b>security and privacy of data</b>, dealing with synchronization of sensitive documents stored in Liferay Portal. I have built a working prototype that ensures both privacy of such information and dynamic provisioning of trust (i.e. user revocation), at a small price in terms of performance and usability constraints. Having to deal with a large attack surface (the mobile OS and the network), I have acquired a deep understanding of the Android platform as well as of network protocols such as OAuth 2.</p>

        <p>
        Although as a software engineer I'm still at my beginnings, I have invested the past five years to learn a wide range of programming languages and technologies, driven both by personal curiosity and requirements for studies or work. Still today I spend some of my time in learning new languages and techs (e.g. Scala, node.js, Angular S, and more), and whenever it's convenient I take the chance of a new project to put them into practice and learn.
        </p>
        <p>
        My skills focus on <b>Web and mobile development</b> across many development stacks. While I prefer to work on the <b>front-end</b> - and often starting from the design of the UI - I can work also on the <b>back-end</b>, moreover I have experience in <b>system administration</b> of Microsoft and Linux servers.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in good design principles and in legible, maintainable and reusable code. I also believe to be a good team player and to work well with AGILE methods, besides I'm familiar with <b>project management tools</b> and I'm currently discovering test-driven development and behavioural-driven development.</p>
        <p>Finally, I'm keen to work hard and progress quickly to become a lead product developer and take responsibility for both the product's success and shortcomings.

      <div class="row text">
        <p>
        While still attending my studies I was requested to perform some works as a freelancer, which I accepted, having considered such offers a good opportunity to make new experiences. I then had to organize my time to deal both with my studies and the additional works, which I mostly carried out at night. The freelance work initally involved mobile app development for Android and iOS - starting off from the experience earned with my two theses - and lately it required the development of a frontend Web app in Bootstrap and jQuery. 
        </p>
        <p>By working individually on all aspects of the resulting product I learned how to plan and estimate the project, to collect and implement requirements, to account for changements, and to make decisions to solve problems and meet the customer's needs. I have summerized my works in the timeline below.

              <p>I needed a cost-effective surveillance system to be placed in an abandoned area with no cabled Internet service and no electricity. <br>I ended up building an Android app by myself that could record video at 1080p with a Samsung Galaxy SII and send motion alarm snapshots through a 3G connection. <br>The phone is powered by a sealed battery with a life of 5 days that can be extended with a solar panel.<br><br><br></p>

              <p>I used to waste a lot of time on a website of classified ads, which oddly for me was a good relaxation. <br>Then after skimming across hundreds of classifieds, I identified some interesting patterns that I wanted to explore better. <br>So I decided to learn Scrapy and build a crawler to fetch some data, which I eventually stored in MongoDB instead of MySQL just to learn something more. I still have 1GB of data ready to be mined and visualized.</p>
